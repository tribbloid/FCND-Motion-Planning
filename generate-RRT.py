# # Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT)
#
# Your task is to generate an RRT based on the following pseudocode:
#
# ```
# def generate_RRT(x_init, num_vertices, dt):
#     rrt = RRT(x_init)
#     for k in range(num_vertices):
#         x_rand = sample_state()
#         x_near = nearest_neighbor(x_rand, rrt)
#         u = select_input(x_rand, x_near)
#         x_new = new_state(x_near, u, dt)
#         # directed edge
#         rrt.add_edge(x_near, x_new, u)
#     return rrt
# ```
#
# The `RRT` class has already been implemented. Your task is to complete the implementation of the following functions:
#
# * `sample_state`
# * `nearest_neighbor`
# * `select_input`
# * `new_state`

# environment encoded as a grid
grid = create_grid()

# Let's take a look at the example environment we'll be using.

# In[6]:


plt.imshow(grid, cmap='Greys', origin='upper')


# Next you'll implement the functions necessary to generate an RRT. Feel free to change the function signatures however you please, just remember to update `generate_RRT` accordingly.

# ### Sampling States
#
# The first part of generating an RRT is sampling states based on the environment. The sampled state must be in free space.

# In[7]:


def sample_state(grid):
    x = np.random.uniform(0, grid.shape[0])
    y = np.random.uniform(0, grid.shape[1])
    return (x, y)


# ### Nearest Neighbors
#
# A critical part of the RRT procedure is finding the closest vertex to the sampled random point. This the most computationally intensive part so be mindful of that. Depending on the number of vertices a naive implementation will run into trouble quickly.

# In[8]:


def nearest_neighbor(x_rand, rrt):
    closest_dist = 100000
    closest_vertex = None
    x_rand = np.array(x_rand)

    for v in rrt.vertices:
        d = np.linalg.norm(x_rand - np.array(v[:2]))
        if d < closest_dist:
            closest_dist = d
            closest_vertex = v
    return closest_vertex


# ### Selecting Inputs
#
# Select input which moves `x_near` closer to `x_rand`. This should return the angle or orientation of the vehicle.

# In[9]:


def select_input(x_rand, x_near):
    return np.arctan2(x_rand[1] - x_near[1], x_rand[0] - x_near[0])


# ### New State
#
#

# The new vertex `x_new` is calculated by travelling from the current vertex `x_near` with a orientation `u` for time `dt`.

# In[10]:


def new_state(x_near, u, dt):
    nx = x_near[0] + np.cos(u) * dt
    ny = x_near[1] + np.sin(u) * dt
    return [nx, ny]


# ### Putting It All Together
#
# Awesome! Now we'll put everything together and generate an RRT.

# In[11]:


def generate_RRT(grid, x_init, num_vertices, dt):
    rrt = RRT(x_init)

    for _ in range(num_vertices):

        x_rand = sample_state(grid)
        # sample states until a free state is found
        while grid[int(x_rand[0]), int(x_rand[1])] == 1:
            x_rand = sample_state(grid)

        x_near = nearest_neighbor(x_rand, rrt)
        u = select_input(x_rand, x_near)
        x_new = new_state(x_near, u, dt)

        if grid[int(x_new[0]), int(x_new[1])] == 0:
            # the orientation `u` will be added as metadata to
            # the edge
            rrt.add_edge(x_near, x_new, u)

    return rrt


# Feel free to change any of the values below.

# In[12]:


num_vertices = 300
dt = 1
x_init = (50, 50)

rrt = generate_RRT(grid, x_init, num_vertices, dt)

# Now let's plot the generated RRT.

# In[ ]:


plt.imshow(grid, cmap='Greys', origin='lower')
plt.plot(x_init[0], x_init[1], 'ro')

for (v1, v2) in rrt.edges:
    plt.plot([v1[1], v2[1]], [v1[0], v2[0]], 'y-')

plt.show()
